## Prerequisites

1. [Install Archon](/getting-started/installation/)
2. [Install Claude Code](/getting-started/ai-assistants/#claude-code) — Archon orchestrates it but does not bundle it
3. Authenticate with Claude: run `claude /login` (uses your existing Claude Pro/Max subscription)
4. In compiled Archon binaries, set `CLAUDE_BIN_PATH` (see [Binary path configuration](/getting-started/ai-assistants/#binary-path-configuration-compiled-binaries-only))
5. Navigate to any git repository
6. For private repos: set `GH_TOKEN` (GitHub), `GITLAB_TOKEN` (GitLab), or `GITEA_TOKEN` (Gitea/Forgejo) — Archon uses these to authenticate when cloning

## Run Your First Workflow

```bash
# List available workflows
archon workflow list

# Ask Archon to assist with your codebase
archon workflow run assist "What does this codebase do?"

# Run a code review
archon workflow run smart-pr-review
```
