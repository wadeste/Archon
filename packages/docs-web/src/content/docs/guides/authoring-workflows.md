This guide explains how to create workflows that orchestrate multiple commands into automated pipelines. Read [Authoring Commands](/guides/authoring-commands/) first — workflows are built from commands.

## What is a Workflow?

A workflow is a **YAML file** that defines a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of commands to execute. Workflows enable:

- **Multi-step automation**: Chain multiple AI agents together
- **Parallel execution**: Independent nodes run concurrently
- **Conditional branching**: Route to different paths based on node output
- **Artifact passing**: Output from one node becomes input for downstream nodes
- **Iterative loops**: Loop nodes repeat until a completion signal

```yaml
name: fix-github-issue
description: Investigate and fix a GitHub issue end-to-end

nodes:
  - id: investigate
    command: investigate-issue

  - id: implement
    command: implement-issue
    depends_on: [investigate]
    context: fresh
```

> **Using defaults as templates:** Archon ships default workflows in `.archon/workflows/defaults/` (12 bundled into the binary, plus additional ones available on disk in source builds). Browse them for real-world examples, then copy and modify:
> ```bash
> cp .archon/workflows/defaults/archon-fix-github-issue.yaml .archon/workflows/my-fix-issue.yaml
> ```
> Same-named files in `.archon/workflows/` override the bundled defaults.

---

## File Location

Workflows live in `.archon/workflows/` relative to the working directory:

```
.archon/
├── workflows/
│   ├── my-workflow.yaml
│   └── review/
│       └── full-review.yaml    # Subdirectories work
└── commands/
    └── [commands used by workflows]
```

Archon discovers workflows recursively - subdirectories are fine. If a workflow file fails to load (syntax error, validation failure), it's skipped and the error is reported via `/workflow list`.

> **Global workflows:** For workflows that apply to every project, place them in `~/.archon/workflows/`. Global workflows are overridden by same-named repo workflows. See [Global Workflows](/guides/global-workflows/).

> **CLI vs Server:** The CLI reads workflow files from wherever you run it (sees uncommitted changes). The server reads from the workspace clone at `~/.archon/workspaces/owner/repo/`, which only syncs from the remote before worktree creation. If you edit a workflow locally but don't push, the server won't see it.

---

## Workflow Structure

Workflows use DAG-based execution with `nodes:`. Each node runs a command or inline prompt, declares dependencies, and supports conditional branching:

```yaml
name: classify-and-fix
description: Classify issue type, then run the appropriate fix path

nodes:
  - id: classify
    command: classify-issue
    output_format:
      type: object
      properties:
        type:
          type: string
          enum: [BUG, FEATURE]
      required: [type]

  - id: investigate
    command: investigate-bug
    depends_on: [classify]
    when: "$classify.output.type == 'BUG'"

  - id: plan
    command: plan-feature
    depends_on: [classify]
    when: "$classify.output.type == 'FEATURE'"

  - id: implement
    command: implement-changes
    depends_on: [investigate, plan]
    trigger_rule: none_failed_min_one_success
```

Nodes without `depends_on` run immediately. Nodes in the same topological layer run concurrently via `Promise.allSettled`. Skipped nodes (failed `when:` condition or `trigger_rule`) propagate their skipped state to dependants.

> **Note:** The `steps:` (sequential) format has been removed. All workflows use `nodes:` (DAG) format exclusively.

### Node Fields

**Node types** — exactly one required per node (mutually exclusive):

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `command` | string | Command name to load from `.archon/commands/` |
| `prompt` | string | Inline prompt string |
| `bash` | string | Shell script (no AI). Stdout captured as `$nodeId.output`. Optional `timeout` (ms, default 120000) |
| `script` | string | TypeScript/JavaScript (via `bun`) or Python (via `uv`) — inline code or named reference to `.archon/scripts/`. Stdout captured as `$nodeId.output`. Requires `runtime: bun` or `runtime: uv`. Optional `deps` (uv only) and `timeout` (ms, default 120000). See [Script Nodes](/guides/script-nodes/) |
| `loop` | object | Iterative AI prompt until completion signal. See [Loop Nodes](/guides/loop-nodes/) |
| `approval` | object | Pauses workflow for human review. See [Approval Nodes](/guides/approval-nodes/) |
| `cancel` | string | Terminates the workflow run with a reason string. Uses existing cancellation plumbing — in-flight parallel nodes are stopped |

**Common fields** — apply to all node types:

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `id` | string | required | Unique node identifier. Used in `depends_on`, `when:`, and `$id.output` substitution |
| `depends_on` | string[] | `[]` | Node IDs that must complete before this node runs |

| `trigger_rule` | string | `all_success` | Join semantics when multiple upstreams exist |
| `context` | `'fresh'` \| `'shared'` | — | `fresh` = new session; `shared` = inherit from prior node. Defaults to `fresh` for parallel layers, inherited for sequential |
| `idle_timeout` | number | — | Kill node if idle for this many milliseconds |
| `retry` | object | — | Per-node retry configuration. See [Retry Configuration](#retry-configuration) |
| `always_run` | boolean | `false` | Opt out of resume caching: re-run this node on resume even if a prior run completed it. See [Opting Out of Resume Caching](#opting-out-of-resume-caching) |

**AI node options** — apply to `command` and `prompt` nodes:

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `provider` | string | inherited | Per-node provider override (any registered provider, e.g. `'claude'`, `'codex'`) |
| `model` | string | inherited | Per-node model override |
| `output_format` | object | — | JSON Schema for structured output. SDK-enforced on Claude and Codex; best-effort on Pi (schema appended to prompt, JSON extracted from result text) |

| `fallbackModel` | string | — | Model to use if primary model fails (Claude SDK-internal). Claude only. Also settable at workflow level |
| `on_failure_model` | string | — | Archon-level model failover: full model path tried when the primary model fails or its per-run circuit breaker is open. Any provider. Per-node only |
| `betas` | string[] | — | SDK beta feature flags (e.g., `'context-1m-2025-08-07'`). Claude only. Also settable at workflow level |
| `sandbox` | object | — | OS-level filesystem/network restrictions for the Claude subprocess. Claude only. Also settable at workflow level |

### Claude SDK Advanced Options

These fields map directly to Claude Agent SDK options. All are Claude-only — Codex nodes emit a warning and ignore them. They can be set **per-node** or at the **workflow level** as defaults (per-node takes precedence). `maxBudgetUsd` and `systemPrompt` are per-node only.

**effort** — reasoning depth:

```yaml
- id: thorough-review
  command: review
  effort: high   # 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'max'
```

**thinking** — extended thinking mode (string shorthand or object form):

```yaml
- id: deep-analysis
  command: analyze
  thinking: adaptive              # 'adaptive' | 'disabled'
  # thinking: { type: enabled, budgetTokens: 8000 }  # object form
```

**maxBudgetUsd** — per-node USD cost cap (node fails with error if exceeded):

```yaml
- id: expensive-step
  command: generate
  maxBudgetUsd: 2.50
```

**systemPrompt** — override the default `claude_code` system prompt:

```yaml
- id: security-review
  prompt: "Review this code for vulnerabilities"
  systemPrompt: "You are a security expert specializing in TypeScript. Focus only on security issues."
```

**fallbackModel** — use a different model if the primary fails:

```yaml
- id: implement
  command: implement
  model: claude-opus-4-5
  fallbackModel: claude-sonnet-4-6
```

**betas** — SDK beta feature flags:

```yaml
- id: long-context-node
  command: summarize
  betas: ['context-1m-2025-08-07']
```

**sandbox** — OS-level filesystem/network restrictions (layers on top of worktree isolation):

```yaml
- id: untrusted-code-analysis
  command: analyze-external
  sandbox:
    enabled: true
    network:
      allowedDomains: []
      allowManagedDomainsOnly: true
    filesystem:
      denyWrite: ['/etc', '/usr']
```

**Workflow-level defaults** (inherited by all Claude nodes unless overridden per-node):

```yaml
name: my-workflow
effort: high         # All Claude nodes use high effort by default
thinking: adaptive   # All Claude nodes use adaptive thinking
fallbackModel: claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
betas: ['context-1m-2025-08-07']
sandbox:
  enabled: true

nodes:
  - id: step1
    command: step1
    # Inherits workflow-level effort, thinking, fallbackModel, betas, sandbox

  - id: step2
    command: step2
    effort: low      # Per-node override — ignores workflow-level effort
```

### `trigger_rule` Values

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `all_success` | Run only if all upstream deps completed successfully (default) |
| `one_success` | Run if at least one upstream dep completed successfully |
| `none_failed_min_one_success` | Run if no deps failed AND at least one succeeded (skipped deps are ok) |
| `all_done` | Run when all deps are in a terminal state (completed, failed, or skipped) |

### `when:` Condition Syntax

Conditions gate whether a node runs based on upstream node outputs.

**String operators** (value compared as string):
```yaml
when: "$nodeId.output == 'VALUE'"
when: "$nodeId.output != 'VALUE'"
when: "$nodeId.output.field == 'VALUE'"    # JSON dot notation for output_format nodes
```

**Numeric operators** (both sides must parse as numbers; fail-closed if not):
```yaml
when: "$nodeId.output > '80'"
when: "$nodeId.output >= '0.9'"
when: "$nodeId.output < '100'"
when: "$nodeId.output <= '5'"
when: "$nodeId.output.score >= '0.9'"      # dot notation + numeric comparison
```

**Compound expressions** (`&&` binds tighter than `||`):
```yaml
when: "$a.output == 'X' && $b.output != 'Y'"
when: "$a.output == 'X' || $b.output == 'Y'"
when: "$score.output > '80' && $flag.output == 'true'"
# Precedence: (A && B) || C
when: "$a.output == 'X' && $b.output == 'Y' || $c.output == 'Z'"
```

- `$nodeId.output` references the full output string of a completed node
- `$nodeId.output.field` accesses a JSON field (for `output_format` nodes)
- Invalid or unparseable expressions default to `false` (fail-closed — node is skipped with a warning)
- Numeric operators fail-closed if either side is not a finite number
- Parentheses are not supported — use standard AND/OR precedence to structure conditions
- Skipped nodes propagate their skipped state to dependants

### `$node_id.output` Substitution

In node prompts and commands, reference the output of any upstream node:

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: classify
    command: classify-issue

  - id: fix
    command: implement-fix
    depends_on: [classify]
    # The command file can use $classify.output or $classify.output.field
```

Variable substitution order:
1. Standard variables (`$WORKFLOW_ID`, `$USER_MESSAGE`, `$ARTIFACTS_DIR`, etc.)
2. Node output references (`$nodeId.output`, `$nodeId.output.field`)

### `output_format` for Structured JSON

Use `output_format` to enforce JSON output from an AI node. For Claude, the schema is passed via the SDK's `outputFormat` option and `structured_output` is used directly. For Codex (v0.116.0+), the schema is passed via `TurnOptions.outputSchema` and the agent's inline JSON response is used. Both ensure clean JSON for `when:` conditions and `$nodeId.output` substitution:

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: classify
    command: classify-issue
    output_format:
      type: object
      properties:
        type:
          type: string
          enum: [BUG, FEATURE]
        severity:
          type: string
          enum: [low, medium, high]
      required: [type]
```

- The output is captured as a JSON string and available via `$classify.output` (full JSON) or `$classify.output.type` (field access)
- Use `output_format` when downstream nodes need to branch on specific values via `when:`

### `allowed_tools` and `denied_tools` for Tool Restrictions

Restrict which built-in tools a node can use without relying on prompt instructions. Restrictions are enforced at the Claude SDK level.

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: review
    command: code-review
    allowed_tools: [Read, Grep, Glob]   # whitelist — only these tools available

  - id: implement
    command: implement-feature
    denied_tools: [WebSearch, WebFetch] # blacklist — remove these tools

  - id: mcp-only
    command: mcp-command
    allowed_tools: []                   # empty list = disable all built-in tools
```

- `allowed_tools: []` disables all built-in tools (useful for MCP-only nodes). Use the `mcp` field on a node to attach per-node MCP servers — see [Node Fields](#node-fields)
- If both are set, `denied_tools` is applied after `allowed_tools`
- `undefined` (field absent) and `[]` have different semantics — absent means use default tool set, `[]` means no tools
- Claude only — Codex nodes/steps emit a warning and continue (Codex doesn't support per-call tool restrictions)

### Inline sub-agents

Define Claude sub-agents directly in the workflow YAML, without authoring `.claude/agents/*.md` files. The main agent can spawn them in parallel via the `Task` tool — useful for map-reduce patterns where a cheap model (e.g. Haiku) briefs items and a stronger model reduces.

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: triage
    prompt: |
      Fetch open issues via `gh issue list ...`. For each issue, spawn the
      brief-gen sub-agent in parallel (one message, multiple Task tool calls)
      to produce a 2-3 sentence brief. Then cluster briefs for duplicates.
    model: sonnet
    allowed_tools: [Bash, Read, Write, Task]
    agents:
      brief-gen:
        description: Summarises a single GitHub issue in 2-3 sentences
        prompt: |
          You are concise. Read the issue provided in the caller's prompt.
          Return JSON { summary, primarySymptom, affectedArea }.
        model: haiku
        tools: [Bash, Read]
```

Keys:

- Agent IDs must be **kebab-case** (`^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`)
- Each definition requires `description` and `prompt`; `model`, `tools`, `disallowedTools`, `skills`, and `maxTurns` are optional
- Map is merged with any SDK-level agents and with the internal `dag-node-skills` wrapper created by `skills:` — user-defined agents win on ID collision (a warning is logged when this happens)
- Claude only. Codex and community providers that don't support inline agents emit a warning and ignore the field

**When to use `agents:` vs `.claude/agents/*.md` files:**

- **`agents:` (inline)** — use when the sub-agent is specific to ONE workflow's needs. Keeps the workflow self-contained in a single YAML file; travels cleanly in PRs and forks.
- **`.claude/agents/*.md` (on-disk)** — use when the sub-agent is shared across multiple workflows OR the whole project (for example, a `triage-agent` used by several maintenance workflows). On-disk agents live outside workflow YAMLs and are picked up automatically by the Claude Agent SDK.

Both sources coexist — inline agents and on-disk agents are both available to `Task(subagent_type=...)` at runtime.

## Retry Configuration

Every node automatically retries on **transient** errors (SDK subprocess crashes, rate limits, network timeouts) using a default configuration: **2 retries** (3 total attempts), **3 s base delay** with exponential backoff. You will see a platform notification before each retry attempt.

To customise, add a `retry:` block:

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: flaky-node
    command: flaky-command
    retry:
      max_attempts: 3       # 3 retries = 4 total attempts
      delay_ms: 5000
      on_error: transient

  - id: aggressive-retry
    prompt: "Summarise the output"
    retry:
      max_attempts: 4       # 4 retries = 5 total attempts
      on_error: all         # Retry even non-transient errors (use with caution)
```

### Retry Fields

| Field | Type | Default | Constraints | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `max_attempts` | number | `2` | 1–5 | Number of retry attempts (not including the initial attempt). `1` = one retry (2 total attempts) |
| `delay_ms` | number | `3000` | 1000–60000 | Base delay in ms before the first retry. Doubles each attempt (exponential backoff) |
| `on_error` | `'transient'` \| `'all'` | `'transient'` | — | Which errors trigger a retry. `'transient'` = SDK crashes, rate limits, network timeouts only. `'all'` = any error including unknown errors (FATAL errors such as auth failures are never retried regardless) |

### Error Classification

Archon classifies errors into three buckets before deciding whether to retry:

| Class | Examples | Retried by default? |
|-------|----------|---------------------|
| **FATAL** | Auth failure, permission denied, credit balance exhausted | Never (even with `on_error: all`) |
| **TRANSIENT** | Process crashed (`exited with code`), rate limit, network timeout | Yes |
| **UNKNOWN** | Unrecognised error messages | No (unless `on_error: all`) |

### Retry Notifications

Before each retry the platform receives a message like:

```
Node `node-id` failed with transient error (attempt 1/3). Retrying in 3s...
```

### Two-Layer Retry Stack

Archon uses two independent retry layers:

```
SDK subprocess retry (claude.ts)  — 3 total attempts, 2 s base backoff
    ↓ only if all SDK retries exhausted
Node retry (dag-executor)  — default 2 retries, 3 s base backoff
    ↓ only if all node retries exhausted
Workflow fails → user opts in to resume on next invocation
```

This means a single transient crash may trigger up to **3 SDK retries** before a single node retry attempt is consumed.

> **DAG resume**: For `nodes:` (DAG) workflows, resume is opt-in — pass `--resume` to `archon workflow run`, run `archon workflow resume <id>`, or use the web UI resume button. Plain `archon workflow run <name>` always starts a fresh run. See [DAG Resume on Failure](#dag-resume-on-failure) below.

---

## DAG Resume on Failure

When a `nodes:` (DAG) workflow fails, the prior run stays in the database as a candidate for resume. Resume is **explicit**: you opt in by flag or button.

**How to resume:**

- **CLI**: `archon workflow run <name> --resume` resumes the most recent failed run for `(workflow_name, cwd)`. Or `archon workflow resume <run-id>` to target a specific run.
- **Chat (web)**: Approving or rejecting a paused workflow auto-resumes from where it left off (the platform already knows the run id).
- **Web UI**: Resume button on the workflow card.

**What happens on resume:**

1. The CLI / orchestrator looks up the resumable run, loads its `node_completed` events to determine which nodes finished successfully, and transitions the row back to `running`.
2. Completed nodes are skipped; only failed and not-yet-run nodes are executed.
3. You receive a platform message like: `Resuming workflow — skipping 3 already-completed node(s).`

> **Why opt-in?** Earlier versions silently auto-resumed on plain `archon workflow run`, which caused state from prior failed runs (e.g. cached node outputs with stale inputs) to bleed into new invocations of the same workflow at the same path. See #1392 for the bug; now resume is always a user-driven decision.

**Crashed servers / orphaned runs**: Archon does **not** auto-fail `running` rows on server startup — that would kill workflows actively executing in another process (CLI, adapter). If a server crash leaves a row stuck as `running`, it remains visible in the dashboard (the Dashboard nav tab shows a count of running workflows). Transition it to a terminal status explicitly:

- **Web UI**: click the Abandon or Cancel button on the workflow card. Abandon marks the run `cancelled` and keeps completed-node history. Cancel also terminates any in-flight subprocess.
- **CLI**: `archon workflow abandon <run-id>` (equivalent to the dashboard Abandon button). Run IDs are listed by `archon workflow status`.

Once the row reaches a terminal status, you can resume it explicitly via the paths above. Plain `archon workflow run` never resumes implicitly.

> Not to be confused with `archon workflow cleanup [days]`, which **deletes** old terminal runs (`completed`/`failed`/`cancelled`) from the database for disk hygiene. It does not transition `running` rows.

**Known limitation**: AI session context from prior nodes is not restored. If a downstream node relies on in-context knowledge from a prior run's session (rather than artifacts), it may need to re-read those artifacts explicitly.

**Fresh start**: If zero nodes completed in the prior run, Archon starts fresh (no nodes to skip).

### Opting Out of Resume Caching

By default, resume skips any node that completed successfully in the prior run and feeds its cached output to downstream consumers. That's the right behavior when a node's exit code captures the validity of its output (e.g. AI prompts, scripts that produce structured stdout).

It's the wrong behavior when a node's success status doesn't capture output validity — typically a producer whose exit code reports the side effect (a file written, a service called) but whose downstream consumer parses the side effect's contents on every run. If the producer succeeded but wrote garbage, resume will replay the cached "success" forever without ever re-executing the producer.

Set `always_run: true` on the node to force re-execution on resume, even when the prior run marked it completed:

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: fetch-data
    bash: ./scripts/download.sh > $ARTIFACTS_DIR/data.json
    always_run: true        # Re-fetch on resume; download.sh exit code doesn't validate the JSON

  - id: process-data
    prompt: "Summarize $ARTIFACTS_DIR/data.json"
    depends_on: [fetch-data]
```

On resume, `fetch-data` re-runs regardless of prior success, so `process-data` reads a freshly produced file. Normal cached nodes in the same run are still skipped — `always_run` is per-node.

## The Artifact Chain

Workflows work because **artifacts pass data between nodes**:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│ Node 1          │     │ Node 2          │     │ Node 3          │
│ investigate     │     │ implement       │     │ create-pr       │
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │
│ Reads: input    │     │ Reads: artifact │     │ Reads: git diff │
│ Writes: artifact│────▶│ Writes: code    │────▶│ Writes: PR      │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
         │                       │
         ▼                       ▼
  $ARTIFACTS_DIR/         src/feature.ts
  issues/issue-123.md     src/feature.test.ts
```

### Designing Artifact Flow

When creating a workflow, plan the artifact chain:

| Node | Reads | Writes |
|------|-------|--------|
| `investigate-issue` | GitHub issue via `gh` | `$ARTIFACTS_DIR/issues/issue-{n}.md` |
| `implement-issue` | Artifact from `investigate-issue` | Code files, tests |
| `create-pr` | Git diff | GitHub PR |

Each command must know:
- Where to find its input
- Where to write its output
- What format to use

---

## Model Configuration

Workflows can configure AI models and provider-specific options at the workflow level.

### Configuration Priority

Model and options are resolved in this order:

1. **Workflow-level** - Explicit settings in the workflow YAML
2. **Config defaults** - `assistants.*` in `.archon/config.yaml`
3. **SDK defaults** - Built-in defaults from Claude/Codex SDKs

### Provider and Model

```yaml
name: my-workflow
provider: claude     # Any registered provider (default: from config)
model: sonnet        # Model override (default: from config assistants.claude.model)
```

**Model strings:** Whatever you write in `model:` is forwarded verbatim to the resolved provider's SDK. Archon doesn't keep an internal allow-list, because vendor SDKs ship new models faster than this doc can. The provider's API decides whether the string is valid at request time.

Common shapes you'll see in practice:

- **Claude (Anthropic):** family aliases (`sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`), full model IDs (`claude-opus-4-7`, `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`), context-window suffixed forms (`opus[1m]`, `claude-opus-4-7[1m]`), or `inherit` to reuse the previous session's model.
- **Codex (OpenAI):** any OpenAI model ID — `gpt-5.3-codex`, `gpt-5.2`, `o5-pro`, etc.
- **Pi (community):** `<backend>/<model-id>` refs — e.g. `google/gemini-2.5-pro`, `openrouter/qwen/qwen3-coder`.
- **Copilot (community):** GitHub Copilot model names — e.g. `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `claude-sonnet-4.5`, or `auto`.

If the SDK rejects the string at request time, the node fails loudly with the SDK's error message — Archon never silently re-routes a model from one provider to another based on the string.

**Provider selection is independent of the model string** — a `model: opus[1m]` node with no `provider:` field will route to your `defaultAssistant` regardless of the model name. Always pair a provider-specific model string with an explicit `provider:` on the node.

### Codex-Specific Options

```yaml
name: my-workflow
provider: codex
model: gpt-5.3-codex
modelReasoningEffort: medium    # 'minimal' | 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'xhigh'
webSearchMode: live             # 'disabled' | 'cached' | 'live'
additionalDirectories:
  - /absolute/path/to/other/repo
  - /path/to/shared/library
```

**Model reasoning effort:**
- `minimal`, `low` - Fast, cheaper
- `medium` - Balanced (default)
- `high`, `xhigh` - More thorough, expensive

**Web search mode:**
- `disabled` - No web access (default)
- `cached` - Use cached search results
- `live` - Real-time web search

**Additional directories:**
- Codex can access files outside the codebase
- Useful for shared libraries, documentation repos
- Must be absolute paths

### Web Execution Mode

By default, workflows started from the **Web UI** run in the background — execution is
dispatched to an internal worker conversation and results appear only in the workflow run
log, not in the chat window.

Set `interactive: true` to run the workflow in the **foreground** (same as CLI, Slack,
Telegram, and GitHub): all AI output and approval gate messages stream directly to the
user's chat window.

```yaml
name: my-interactive-workflow
interactive: true   # Web UI: foreground execution (output visible in chat)

nodes:
  - id: plan
    prompt: "Create a plan for $USER_MESSAGE"
  - id: review-gate
    approval:
      message: "Does this plan look good?"
    depends_on: [plan]
  - id: implement
    command: implement
    depends_on: [review-gate]
```

**When to use `interactive: true`:**
- Workflows with **approval nodes** — users must see the AI output and respond inline
- Workflows with **interactive loop nodes** (`loop.interactive: true`) — the loop gate pause requires foreground execution to deliver the gate message and run ID to the user
- Multi-turn workflows where the user needs to provide feedback at each step
- Any workflow where the response must appear in the user's active chat thread

**Platforms:** `interactive` only affects the web platform. CLI, Slack, Telegram, and
GitHub always run workflows in foreground mode regardless of this setting.

### Provider Validation

Workflows are validated at load time for **provider identity only**:
- Both the workflow-level `provider:` and any per-node `provider:` overrides must name a registered provider (`claude`, `codex`, `pi`, `copilot`).
- Validation errors are shown in `/workflow list`.

Example validation error:
```
Unknown provider 'claud'. Registered: claude, codex, pi, copilot
```

Model strings are not validated at load time — they're forwarded to the SDK as-is and validated by the upstream API at request time.

### Resource Validation (CLI)

To validate that all referenced command files, MCP config files, and skill directories exist on disk, run:

```bash
archon validate workflows <name>
```

This checks resource resolution beyond what load-time validation covers. Use `--json` for machine-readable output. See the [CLI Reference](/reference/cli/) for details.

### Example: Config Defaults + Workflow Override

**`.archon/config.yaml`:**
```yaml
assistants:
  claude:
    model: haiku  # Fast model for most tasks
  codex:
    model: gpt-5.3-codex
    modelReasoningEffort: low
    webSearchMode: disabled
```

**Workflow with override:**
```yaml
name: complex-analysis
description: Deep code analysis requiring powerful model
provider: claude
model: opus  # Override config default (haiku) for this workflow

nodes:
  - id: analyze
    command: analyze-architecture

  - id: report
    command: generate-report
    depends_on: [analyze]
    context: fresh
```

The workflow uses `opus` instead of the config default `haiku`, but other settings inherit from config.

## Workflow Description Best Practices

Write descriptions that help with routing and user understanding:

```yaml
description: |
  Investigate and fix a GitHub issue end-to-end.

  **Use when**: User provides a GitHub issue number or URL
  **NOT for**: Feature requests, refactoring, documentation

  **Produces**:
  - Investigation artifact
  - Code changes
  - Pull request linked to issue

  **Steps**:
  1. Investigate root cause
  2. Implement fix with tests
  3. Create PR
```

Good descriptions include:
- What the workflow does
- When to use it (and when NOT to)
- What it produces
- High-level steps

---

## Variable Substitution

All workflows support variable substitution in prompts and commands. The most commonly used:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `$ARGUMENTS` / `$USER_MESSAGE` | The user's input message that triggered the workflow |
| `$WORKFLOW_ID` | Unique ID for this workflow run |
| `$ARTIFACTS_DIR` | Pre-created artifacts directory for this workflow run |
| `$BASE_BRANCH` | Base branch (auto-detected or configured) |
| `$DOCS_DIR` | Documentation directory path (default: `docs/`) |
| `$CONTEXT` | GitHub issue/PR context (if available) |
| `$nodeId.output` | Output of a completed upstream node |
| `$nodeId.output.field` | JSON field from a structured upstream node output |

See the [Variable Reference](/reference/variables/) for the complete list, including `$LOOP_USER_INPUT`, `$REJECTION_REASON`, positional arguments, substitution order, and context variable behavior.

Example:
```yaml
prompt: |
  Workflow: $WORKFLOW_ID
  Original request: $USER_MESSAGE

  GitHub context:
  $CONTEXT

  [Instructions...]
```

## Example Workflows

### Quick Fix

```yaml
name: quick-fix
description: |
  Fast bug fix without full investigation.
  Use when: Simple, obvious bugs.

nodes:
  - id: fix
    command: analyze-and-fix

  - id: pr
    command: create-pr
    depends_on: [fix]
    context: fresh
```

### Investigation Pipeline

```yaml
name: fix-github-issue
description: |
  Full investigation and fix for GitHub issues.
  Use when: User provides issue number/URL

nodes:
  - id: investigate
    command: investigate-issue

  - id: implement
    command: implement-issue
    depends_on: [investigate]
    context: fresh
```

### Parallel Review

```yaml
name: comprehensive-pr-review
description: |
  Multi-agent PR review covering code, comments, tests, and security.

nodes:
  - id: scope
    command: create-review-scope

  - id: code-review
    command: code-review-agent
    depends_on: [scope]
    context: fresh

  - id: comment-review
    command: comment-quality-agent
    depends_on: [scope]
    context: fresh

  - id: test-review
    command: test-coverage-agent
    depends_on: [scope]
    context: fresh

  - id: security-review
    command: security-review-agent

    context: fresh

  - id: synthesize
    command: synthesize-reviews
    depends_on: [code-review, comment-review, test-review, security-review]
    context: fresh
```

### Iterative Implementation (Loop Node)

```yaml
name: implement-prd
description: |
  Autonomously implement a PRD, iterating until all stories pass.

nodes:
  - id: implement-loop
    loop:
      prompt: |
        Read PRD from `.archon/prd.md`.
        Read progress from `.archon/progress.json`.
        Implement the next incomplete story with tests.
        Run validation: `bun run validate`.
        Update progress file.
        If ALL stories complete: <promise>COMPLETE</promise>
      until: COMPLETE
      max_iterations: 15
      fresh_context: true
```

### Classify and Route

```yaml
name: classify-and-fix
description: |
  Classify issue type and run the appropriate path.

  Use when: User reports a bug or requests a feature
  Produces: Code fix (bug path) or feature plan (feature path), then PR

nodes:
  - id: classify
    command: classify-issue
    output_format:
      type: object
      properties:
        type:
          type: string
          enum: [BUG, FEATURE]
      required: [type]

  - id: investigate
    command: investigate-bug
    depends_on: [classify]
    when: "$classify.output.type == 'BUG'"

  - id: plan
    command: plan-feature
    depends_on: [classify]
    when: "$classify.output.type == 'FEATURE'"

  - id: implement
    command: implement-changes
    depends_on: [investigate, plan]
    trigger_rule: none_failed_min_one_success

  - id: create-pr
    command: create-pr
    depends_on: [implement]
    context: fresh
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Gated Execution

Run different paths based on conditions:

```yaml
name: smart-fix
description: Route to appropriate fix strategy based on issue complexity

nodes:
  - id: analyze
    command: analyze-complexity
    output_format:
      type: object
      properties:
        complexity:
          type: string
          enum: [simple, complex]
      required: [complexity]

  - id: quick-fix
    command: quick-fix
    depends_on: [analyze]
    when: "$analyze.output.complexity == 'simple'"

  - id: deep-fix
    command: deep-investigation
    depends_on: [analyze]
    when: "$analyze.output.complexity == 'complex'"
```

### Pattern: Checkpoint and Resume

For long workflows, DAG resume lets you skip already-completed nodes — opt in with `--resume`:

```yaml
name: large-migration
description: Multi-file migration with automatic checkpoint recovery

nodes:
  - id: plan
    command: create-migration-plan

  - id: batch-1
    command: migrate-batch-1
    depends_on: [plan]
    context: fresh

  - id: batch-2
    command: migrate-batch-2
    depends_on: [batch-1]
    context: fresh

  - id: validate
    command: validate-migration
    depends_on: [batch-2]
    context: fresh
```

If the workflow fails at `batch-2`, run `archon workflow run large-migration --resume` to skip `plan` and `batch-1`. Plain `archon workflow run large-migration` (without `--resume`) starts fresh.

### Pattern: Human-in-the-Loop

Use an `approval` node to pause for human review before continuing:

```yaml
name: careful-refactor
description: Refactor with human approval gate

nodes:
  - id: propose
    command: propose-refactor

  - id: review-gate
    approval:
      message: "Review the proposed refactor before proceeding. Check the artifacts directory."
    depends_on: [propose]

  - id: execute
    command: execute-approved-refactor
    depends_on: [review-gate]

  - id: pr
    command: create-pr
    depends_on: [execute]
    context: fresh
```

When the workflow reaches `review-gate`, it pauses and notifies you. Approve or reject via:

- **Natural language** (recommended): Just type your response in the conversation — the system detects the paused workflow and auto-resumes
- **CLI**: `bun run cli workflow approve <run-id>` or `bun run cli workflow reject <run-id>` — auto-resumes
- **Explicit command**: `/workflow approve <run-id>` or `/workflow reject <run-id>` — auto-resumes when issued in the originating conversation
- **Web UI**: Click the Approve/Reject buttons on the dashboard card — auto-resumes for Web-UI-dispatched runs; the Reject dialog includes an optional reason field that flows to `$REJECTION_REASON`
- **API**: `POST /api/workflows/runs/<run-id>/approve` or `/reject`

All four paths auto-resume the workflow from the next node. The user's approval comment is available as `$review-gate.output` in downstream nodes only when `capture_response: true` is set on the approval node. Cross-platform caveat: Web-UI approvals on Slack / Telegram / GitHub-dispatched runs record the decision but do not auto-resume — re-run from the originating platform to continue.

Without `on_reject`: rejecting cancels the workflow.
With `on_reject`: rejecting triggers an AI rework prompt and re-pauses for re-review.
See [Approval Nodes](/guides/approval-nodes/) for full details.

### Pattern: Early Termination with Cancel

Use a `cancel:` node to stop a workflow when a precondition fails — preventing wasted compute on downstream branches:

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: check
    bash: "git merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD origin/main && echo ok || echo blocked"

  - id: stop-if-blocked
    cancel: "PR has merge conflicts — cannot proceed with review"
    depends_on: [check]
    when: "$check.output == 'blocked'"

  - id: review
    prompt: "Review the PR..."
    depends_on: [check]
    when: "$check.output == 'ok'"
```

When a `cancel:` node executes (passes its `when:` gate), it sets the workflow run to `cancelled` with the reason string and stops all in-flight nodes. Unlike node failure, cancellation is intentional — the status is `cancelled`, not `failed`.

### Choosing: Interactive Loop vs Approval with on_reject

Two primitives handle human-in-the-loop iteration. Use the right one for your pattern:

| | Interactive Loop | Approval + on_reject |
|---|---|---|
| YAML | `loop.interactive: true` | `approval.on_reject: { prompt }` |
| User input variable | `$LOOP_USER_INPUT` | `$REJECTION_REASON` |
| How it works | Same prompt runs each iteration, user input injected as variable | Specific on_reject prompt runs only on rejection |
| Best for | **Conversational iteration** — explore, refine, review cycles where the AI and human go back and forth | **Gate-then-fix** — approve to proceed, or reject to trigger a specific corrective action |
| Approval signal | AI detects user intent in its output (`<promise>DONE</promise>`) | User explicitly approves or rejects via button/command |
| Example | PIV loop: explore → user feedback → explore again | Report generation: generate → user rejects → AI revises specific section |

**Interactive loop** (`loop.interactive: true`):

```yaml
- id: refine-plan
  loop:
    prompt: |
      User's feedback: $LOOP_USER_INPUT
      Read the plan, apply feedback, present changes.
    until: PLAN_APPROVED
    max_iterations: 10
    interactive: true
    gate_message: "Review the plan. Provide feedback or say 'approved'."
```

The AI runs each iteration, pauses for user input, user's text feeds into the next iteration via `$LOOP_USER_INPUT`. The AI decides when to emit the completion signal based on the user's response.

**Approval with on_reject** (`approval.on_reject`):

```yaml
- id: review
  approval:
    message: "Review the report. Approve or request changes."
    capture_response: true
    on_reject: { prompt: "Revise based on: $REJECTION_REASON", max_attempts: 5 }
  depends_on: [generate]
```

The workflow pauses at the approval gate. User approves -> workflow continues. User rejects with feedback -> the `on_reject` prompt runs with `$REJECTION_REASON`, then re-pauses at the same gate.

**Rule of thumb**: If the human and AI are having a conversation (exploring, refining, iterating), use an interactive loop. If the workflow should proceed unless the human objects, use an approval gate with `on_reject`.

## Debugging Workflows

### Check Workflow Discovery

```bash
bun run cli workflow list
```

### Run with Verbose Output

```bash
bun run cli workflow run {name} "test input"
```

Watch the streaming output to see each step.

### Check Artifacts

After a workflow runs, check the artifacts in the `$ARTIFACTS_DIR` for that run (located at `~/.archon/workspaces/owner/repo/artifacts/runs/{workflow-id}/`).

### Check Logs

Workflow execution logs to:
```
~/.archon/workspaces/owner/repo/logs/{workflow-id}.jsonl
```

Each line is a JSON event (step start, AI response, tool call, etc.).

---

## Workflow Validation

Before deploying a workflow:

1. **Test each command individually**
   ```bash
   bun run cli workflow run {workflow} "test input"
   ```

2. **Verify artifact flow**
   - Does the first node produce what the second expects?
   - Are paths correct?
   - Is the format complete?

3. **Test edge cases**
   - What if the input is invalid?
   - What if a node fails?
   - What if an artifact is missing?

4. **Check iteration limits** (for loops)
   - Is `max_iterations` reasonable?
   - What happens when limit is hit?

---

## Summary

1. **Workflows orchestrate commands** — YAML files defining a DAG of execution nodes
2. **`nodes:` define the graph** — each node runs a command, inline prompt, bash script, or loop
3. **Artifacts are the glue** — commands communicate via files, not in-memory context
4. **`context: fresh`** — forces a fresh AI session for a node (works from artifacts only)
5. **Parallel by default** — nodes in the same topological layer run concurrently
6. **Conditional branching** — `when:` conditions and `trigger_rule` control which nodes run
7. **`output_format`** — enforce structured JSON output from AI nodes for reliable branching
8. **`allowed_tools` / `denied_tools`** — restrict tools per node (Claude only, SDK-enforced)
9. **`retry:`** — auto-retries transient errors (default: 2 retries / 3 total attempts, 3 s backoff); customize per node
10. **`hooks`** — attach SDK hook callbacks to Claude nodes for tool control and context injection
11. **`mcp:`** — attach per-node MCP servers via JSON config (Codex and Claude)
12. **`skills:`** — preload skills into Claude nodes for domain expertise
13. **`agents:`** — inline Claude sub-agent definitions invokable via the `Task` tool
14. **`effort` / `thinking`** — control reasoning depth and thinking mode per node or workflow (Claude only)
15. **`maxBudgetUsd`** — set a USD cost cap per node; fails with error if exceeded (Claude only)
16. **`systemPrompt`** — override the default system prompt per node (Claude only)
17. **`sandbox`** — OS-level filesystem/network restrictions per node or workflow (Claude only)
18. **Loop nodes** — use `loop:` within a DAG node for iterative execution until completion signal
19. **Defaults as templates** — browse `.archon/workflows/defaults/` for real examples to copy and modify
20. **Test thoroughly** — each command, the artifact flow, and edge cases
