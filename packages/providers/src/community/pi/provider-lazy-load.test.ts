/**
 * Regression test: Pi SDK must not load at module-import time.
 *
 * Pi's `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent/dist/config.js` runs
 * `readFileSync(getPackageJsonPath(), 'utf-8')` at module top-level. Inside
 * a compiled Archon binary `getPackageJsonPath()` resolves to
 * `dirname(process.execPath) + '/package.json'`, which doesn't exist — so
 * any static import chain from `@archon/providers` into the Pi SDK crashes
 * archon at startup with ENOENT before any command runs (v0.3.7 symptom).
 *
 * Detection strategy: replace both Pi SDK packages with `mock.module`
 * factories that flip a boolean the first time something resolves them.
 * Walk the same registration path the CLI and server take and assert
 * neither flag tipped. A throwing factory would abort the failing import
 * before the `expect` calls run, producing a crash at resolution time with
 * no assertion context — counters keep failures actionable.
 *
 * Runs in its own `bun test` invocation because Bun's `mock.module` is
 * process-wide and would poison `provider.test.ts`, which installs benign
 * stubs for the same modules (see CLAUDE.md on test isolation).
