/**
 * Shared best-effort structured-output helpers for providers that have no
 * native JSON-mode equivalent to Claude's `outputFormat` or Codex's
 * `outputSchema`. The approach is two-step:
 *
 *   1. Augment the user prompt with a "respond with JSON matching this schema"
 *      instruction, so instruction-following models emit parseable JSON.
 *   2. After the run completes, parse the accumulated assistant transcript.
 *
 * Models that reliably follow instruction (GPT-5, Claude, Gemini 2.x, recent
 * Qwen Coder, DeepSeek V3) return clean JSON; models that don't produce a
 * parse failure, which the executor surfaces via the existing
 * `dag.structured_output_missing` warning.

CRITICAL: Respond with ONLY a JSON object matching the schema below. No prose before or after the JSON. No markdown code fences. Just the raw JSON object as your final message.

Schema:

/**
 * Attempt to parse an assistant transcript as the structured-output JSON.
 * Handles three common model failure modes:
 *  - trailing/leading whitespace (always stripped)
 *  - markdown code fences (```json ... ``` or bare ``` ... ```) that models
 *    emit despite the "no code fences" instruction in the prompt
 *  - prose preamble followed by a single trailing JSON object — pattern
 *    observed on Minimax M2.7 reasoning models that "think out loud" before
 *    emitting structured output despite explicit JSON-only prompts.
 *
 * Returns the parsed value on success, `undefined` on any failure. Callers
 * treat `undefined` as "structured output unavailable" and degrade via the
 * dag-executor's existing missing-structured-output warning.
